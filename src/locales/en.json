  "info-text-body.1": "The universe and dinosaurs have always been shrouded in a certain romanticism, and many books related to them are stocked on the shelves of bookshops. It's a popular field. What about the deep sea? At the moment, it seems that although it exists on this planet, it remains largely unknown and there are not many books on this subject on the shelves. I want to convey my passionate interest, this website is open to the public as a personal hobby. It is not something that pursues an academic material value, far from it. Therefore, please note that it may contain inaccuracies.",

  "info-text-body.2": "We normally call the deep sea the depths below 200m, but that does not mean that the deep sea is equal to darkness, as it includes worlds where light reaches vaguely. Even if it is completely black by human standards, it is clearly visible to the inhabitants of the deep sea. However, the truth is that it is an unknown biosphere inhabited by organisms that have built a unique world different from that of tuna, sea bream or sardines. These were classified into benthic species and swimming species, and each is grouped by depth. Benthic species belong to the transition zone (200-800m), the upper subtropical zone (800-1500m), lower epitomal zone (1500-3000m), deep water zone (3000-6000m), in the ultra-deep seafloor zone (6000m), swimming species move at the same depths in the mesopelagic, upper ebb, lower ebb, deep water and ultra-deep layers, and there is a deep water layer.",

Various land creatures, including humans, are located in the terrestrial 30%. If the terrestrial biosphere (space part) is 30 metres, the oceanic biosphere is actually 300 times larger than the terrestrial biosphere. Most of it is found in the deep sea. The planet we live on is not the Earth, but a water globe, and it would not be an exaggeration to say that it is a deep-sea globe.",
